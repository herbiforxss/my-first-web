<h2>JavaScript란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript" 
target="_blank"  title="javascript specification">JavaScript</a> is a scripting or programming language that allows you 
to implement complex features on web pages — 
every time a web page does more than just sit 
there and display static information for you to look at — 
displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, 
scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. 
It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, 
two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in 
much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>

JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language 
that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, 
prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, 
supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, 
dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). </p>
